# defm 0.2.1.0

* Returning to CRAN.

* The `defm` now uses the same versioning as the [`barry`](https://github.com/USCbiostats/barry) library (first three numbers). The last number is the patch.


# defm 0.1-1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

* Change how `nobs.DEFM` is documented (per CRAN)

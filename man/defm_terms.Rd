\description{
Model specification for DEFM
}
\details{
In \code{term_defm_transition}, users can specify a particular motif to model. Motifs
are represented by cells with values equal to 1, for example, the matrix:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode y0 y1 y2">}}\preformatted{t0:   1 NA NA
t1:   1  1 NA
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

represents a transition \verb{y0 -> (y1, y2)}. If 0 is a motif of interest, then
the matrix should include 0 to mark zero values.

The function \code{term_defm_transition_formula},
will take the formula and generate the corresponding
input for defm::counter_transition(). Formulas can be specified in the
following ways:
\itemize{
\item Intercept effect: {...} No transition, only including the current state.
\item Transition effect: {...} > {...} Includes current and previous states.
}

The general notation is \verb{[0]y[column id]_[row id]}. A preceeding zero
means that the value of the cell is considered to be zero. The column
id goes between 0 and the number of columns in the array - 1 (so it
is indexed from 0,) and the row id goes from 0 to m_order.
\subsection{Intercept effects}{

Intercept effects only involve a single set of curly brackets. Using the
'greater-than' symbol (i.e., '<') is only for transition effects. When
specifying intercept effects, users can skip the \code{row_id}, e.g.,
\code{y0_0} is equivalent to \code{y0}. If the passed \verb{row id} is different from
the Markov order, i.e., \code{row_id != m_order}, then the function returns
with an error.

Examples:
\itemize{
\item \code{"{y0, 0y1}"} is equivalent to set a motif with the first element equal
to one and the second to zero.
}
}

\subsection{Transition effects}{

Transition effects can be specified using two sets of curly brackets and
an greater-than symbol, i.e., \code{{...} > {...}}. The first set of brackets,
which we call LHS, can only hold \verb{row id} that are less than \code{m_order}.
}

The term \code{term_defm_logit_intercept} will add what is equivalent to an
intercept in a logistic regression. When \code{coords} is specified, then the
function will add one intercept per outcome. These can be weighted by
a covariate.

The \code{+} method is a shortcut for term_formula

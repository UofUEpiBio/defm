@article{Bai2020,
   abstract = {<p>In clinical research, study outcomes usually consist of various patientsâ€™ information corresponding to the treatment. To have a better understanding of the effects of different treatments, one often needs to analyze multiple clinical outcomes simultaneously, while the data are usually mixed with both continuous and discrete variables. We propose the multivariate mixed response model to implement statistical inference based on the conditional grouped continuous model through a pairwise composite-likelihood approach. It can simplify the multivariate model by dealing with three types of bivariate models and incorporating the asymptotical properties of the composite likelihood via the Godambe information. We demonstrate the validity and the statistic power of the multivariate mixed response model through simulation studies and clinical applications. This composite-likelihood method is advantageous for statistical inference on correlated multivariate mixed outcomes.</p>},

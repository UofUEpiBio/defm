Description: Multi-binary response models are a class of models that
    allow for the estimation of multiple binary outcomes simultaneously.
    This package provides functions to estimate and simulate these models using
    the Discrete Exponential-Family Models [DEFM] framework. In it, we implement
    the models described in Vega Yon et al. (2023) <arXiv:2211.00627>.
